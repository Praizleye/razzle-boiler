## Introduction

Push notifications are a powerful tool for engaging users by delivering timely and relevant information directly to their devices. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up push notifications for both online and offline scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A development environment set up for your platform (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Xcode, Neovim)
- Access to a push notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, One Signal or Web push protoca)
- Basic knowledge of the platform's notification system
- Basic knowledge of pwa's and service workers.

## Setting Up Push Notifications

### Online Mode

1. **Register with a Push Notification Service**: Sign up for a service like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) or One Signal but in our case we using **PLAIN WEB PUSH**.
2. **Configure Your App**: Integrate the push notification service SDK into your app.
3. **Obtain Device Tokens**: Implement code to retrieve and store device tokens for sending notifications.
4. **Send Notifications**: Use the push notification service to send messages to the registered devices.

### Offline Mode

1. **Local Storage**: Implement a local storage mechanism (e.g., SQLite, SharedPreferences) to store notifications when the device is offline.
2. **Sync Mechanism**: Create a sync mechanism to check for new notifications when the device comes back online.
3. **Display Notifications**: Implement code to display stored notifications once the device is online.

## Handling Notifications

- **Foreground Handling**: Implement logic to handle notifications when the app is in the foreground.
- **Background Handling**: Implement logic to handle notifications when the app is in the background or closed.
- **User Interaction**: Define actions that users can take when interacting with notifications.
- **Files to look out for**: sw.js file in the public dir, Home.js contains the client push notification logic.

## Testing

- **Simulate Notifications**: Use tools provided by the push notification service to simulate sending notifications.
- **Offline Testing**: Test the offline storage and sync mechanism by disabling the network connection on the device.

## Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**: Address common issues such as missing device tokens, incorrect configuration, and network errors.
- **Debugging Tips**: Provide tips for debugging notification issues, including checking logs and using debugging tools.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you should be able to implement push notifications in both online and offline modes, ensuring that your users receive timely updates regardless of their connectivity status.
